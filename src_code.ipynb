    "\n",
    "In this final assignment of the semester, you will analyze some data from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data Set to determine risk factors for Breast cancer. This project is due on Thursday, December 14th at midnight. You may complete the project in teams of 2-3 people (not more) or you may elect to do it by yourself. One member of the team should submit all relevant files (specified at the end of this notebook), and the names of all team members should be on all documents. All members will receive the same grade. This project is worth 5% of your final grade and may not be skipped. "

    "# Project Overview\n",
    "The American Cancer Society estimates that at the end of this year, 252,710 women will have been diagnosed with a new case of invasive breast cancer.  Since the prognosis of a patient diagnosed with an invasive form of breast cancer improves drastically the earlier the cancer is caught, it is imperative to reexamine current diagnostic methods using the most recent technologies, such as machine learning.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset you will analyze for your paper is the\n",
    " Wisconsin breast cancer data set. The collection contains a list of relevant features computed from a digitized image of a Fine Needle Biopsy (FNA) of a breast cancer growth, in which cells from a suspicious growth in the breast are removed by a needle.  The dataset contains 683 entries, each with 10 features with a class identifier, to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors. \n",
    " \n",
    " Here the term $\\textit{benign}$ refers to a tumor, condition, or growth that is not cancerous and unlikely to metastasize (spread). In particular, benign tumors are localized and slow-growing, meaning they have not spread to other parts of the body and are unlikely to do so in the future. That being said, if a tumor gets large enough, it has the potential to press against blood vessels and nerves which can cause problems. Benign tumors can  usually be removed via surgery. On the other hand, if a tumor has the potential to, or already has spread to other parts of the body, this tumor is said to be $\\textit{malignant}$. This type of tumor possesses an immediate risk as it has the potential to spread to the lymphatic system or circulatory system. If the cancer spreads to other regions of the body, it becomes significantly more difficult to treat as localized surgery will no longer remove all of the dangerous cells. \n",
    " \n",
    " Your job for this project is to  construct a predictive model that takes as input a feature vector of values available  from a FNA and predicts whether or not the patient has cancer. The mathematical model we will use for prediction is called **Logistic Regression**. Don't let the name fool you, this is a mathematical model for classification, a common operation in machine learning.\n",
